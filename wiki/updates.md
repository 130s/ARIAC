# ARIAC 2019 Vs. ARIAC 2020
This section lists all the changes that were made from ARIAC 2019. If you participated in ARIAC 2019 and plan to participate in ARIAC 2020 then you may need to be aware of the following changes:
## New robot
* This year, competitors will have to control a 15 DoF gantry robot to complete the challenges. The robot consists of:
    * 1 linear actuator which allows the base of the robot to move along a small rail.
    * 1 linear actuator which allows the small rail to move along the long rails.
    * 1 rotatory torso which rotates around the base z-axis.
    * Two 6 DoF UR10 arms attached to the torso. 
      * Each arm's base has a fixed joint to the torso.
    * A tray is attached at one of the extremities of the torso. Participants may put parts in this tray while fetching other parts in the environment.
