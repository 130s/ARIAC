1. New robot:
 - This time, competitors will have to control a 15 DoF gantry robot to complete the challenges. The robot consists of:
    * 1 linear actuator which allows the base of the robot to move along a small rail.
    * 1 linear actuator which allows the small rail to move along the long rails.
    * 1 rotatory torso which rotates around the base z-axis.
    * Two 6 DoF UR10 arms attached to the torso. The base of each arm has a fixed joint with the torso.
